With ambient cafes, good wifi availability, small eateries and convenient shops, Old Manali is among the favorite neighbourhood for such people. There are many homestays and hostels offering dorm beds for cheap for longer durations. Manali has many trekking options around it, making it a great base for exploring this side of Himalayas. River Beas provides great rafting options in the nearby town of Kullu. Adjoining Parvati river, lies the Parvati Valley with  Kasol, Manikaran, Tosh and small villages attracting travellers for longer stays. Atal Tunnel now allows travellers to reach Sissu within a few hours making Spiti way more accessible. It snows the most in the months of January & February followed by December and March. If you\\'re very lucky, you might find some snow in April. Tourists flock to Rohtang Pass & Solang valley for various adventure activities including skiing, paragliding, horse-riding & zorbing. Rohtang Pass is almost always covered with snow and can often get overcrowded and see traffic jams.\"]'"
